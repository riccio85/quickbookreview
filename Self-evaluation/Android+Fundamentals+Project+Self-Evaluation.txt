Android Fundamentals Project Self-Evaluation

Instructions: Once you’ve completed your Final Project, please respond to the questions below. This is a chance for you to briefly explain to the grader your thought-process during development.  Once you are done, include this with the source code and accompanying files you are submitting.  Then, give yourself a pat on the back for making a great app!
Questions about Required Components
Permissions
Please elaborate on why you chose the permissions in your app.
The only permission that I use is <uses-permission ndroid:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> required to get the data. 

Content Provider
What is the name of your Content Provider, and how is it backed? (For example, Sunshine’s Content Provider is named WeatherProvider backed by an SQLite database, with two tables: weather and location.)
My ContentProvider name is BooksContentProvider backed by Sqlite database with one table with the name “books”.

What backend does it talk to? (For example, Sunshine talks to the OpenWeatherMap API.)
The backend that I use is http://googleapis.com/books/... 

If your app uses a SyncAdapter, what is it called? What mechanism is used to actually talk over the network? (For example, Sunshine uses HttpURLConnection to talk to the network, but your app may use a third-party library to do the talking.) 
I use intent service and not a SyncAdapter, as I fetch data from Internet only per request, when the user requests to search for a book. I extended IntentService in the class SearchService and used ResultReceiver for receiving a callback result form the service in SearchResultReceiver class.The app uses HttpURLConnection to talk to the network.

What loaders/adapters are used?
I used a class that extends ArrayAdapter<Book> named BookListViewAdapter
and a class that extends CursorAdapter named FavoriteAdapter.
I used LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor> in FavoriteListFragment class and FavoriteDetailFragment class.

User/App State
Please elaborate on how/where your app correctly preserves and restores user or app state. (See rubric for examples on this question)
User text input is preserved on rotation.
When list view is displayed, on rotation the app displays the list view scrolled near possible to list items at rotation. When the app is resumed after the device wakes from sleep (locked) state, the app returns the user to the exact state in which it was last used.
When the app is relaunched from Home or All Apps, the app restores the app state.
When an activity is displayed, the same activity appears on rotation.
